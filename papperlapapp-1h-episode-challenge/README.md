# Papperlapapp 1h episode challenge
Stefan Spittank / Holger Grosse-Plankermann

In this session we (Stefan and Holger) imposed the challenge on ourselves to setup, record, postprocess and publish an episode of our Youtube channel [Papperlapapp - Spa√ü mit Klammern](https://www.youtube.com/@papperlapapp-dev). This is something that usually takes days for us.
To our own suprise we managed to do this! It does not look as "polished" like we would want to, we screwed up recording in english and, and, and ... But we are proud anyhow.
What was the topic? We talked about the JSCraftCamp and about our main takeaways!

And here is the [result](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTWsOSj3A4g).
